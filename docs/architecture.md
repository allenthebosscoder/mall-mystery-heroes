# Architecture

## What this system is

Mall Mystery Heroes is a **Game Master (GM) console** for running a live-action
"assassin" game. Players are assigned targets, hunt each other in the real world,
submit photo proof of kills, and earn points. The GM sits at a laptop and drives
the whole game from a single screen.

The web app in this repository is _only_ the GM console. It is a Create React App
single-page application that talks **directly to Firebase**. There is effectively
no backend of our own — see [Cloud Functions](#cloud-functions) below.

```

Two collaborators are referenced by this codebase's shape but neither is
versioned here, so neither is documented beyond what follows — treat both as
unknowns when changing the `photos` schema or the room document shape:

- **A player-facing mobile app — does not currently exist, anywhere**
  ([improvements.md](./improvements.md) item 33). It is never referenced in
  code, but its existence is implied by two collections prepped for it, in
  opposite directions: `photos` is designed to be _read_ by such an app but
  is never _written_ by anything in this repository — nothing in
  `dbCalls.js` writes a photo document (the test helper that once did was
  dead code, deleted per item 14). `playerMessages`
  (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-messaging-mobile-prep-design.md)
  is the mirror case: written by `/whisper`, `/broadcast`, and
  `/leaderboard`, and now read by `MessageFeed` (`src/components/player_messages_components/MessageFeed.js`)
  via `fetchPlayerMessagesQueryForRoom`, filtered client-side to broadcasts/leaderboard sends and
  whispers addressed to the subscribing player.
  `firestore.rules` scopes both collections to the host rather than to a
  distinct mobile-app identity, for the same reason (item 2). Until this
  app exists, kill-proof photos have no way to enter Firestore except
  manual/emulator seeding.
- **Something Discord-related — no longer present.** `.env` used to carry a
  `DISCORD_TOKEN` that no code in this repository ever read. It was
  previously guessed to be the real integration point for `/broadcast`,
  `/leaderboard`, and `/whisper`, on no more evidence than the stray env
  var — that guess is now moot on two counts: those three commands are
  implemented and target the `playerMessages` collection / a future mobile
  app instead
  (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-messaging-mobile-prep-design.md),
  and the token itself is gone from `.env` as of this writing. Whatever it
  was for, if anything, is no longer this codebase's concern.

### Routes

Defined in `src/App.js`. Three are wrapped in `RequireAuth` — see
[Authentication](#authentication-and-authorization).

| Path                            | Page             | Purpose                                                                                                   | Guarded |

| `/login`                        | `Login`          | Email + password sign-in ("Host Game" lands here)                                                         |         |
| `/login/password-reset`         | `PasswordReset`  | Sends Firebase reset email                                                                                |         |
| `/signup`                       | `SignUp`         | Account creation                                                                                          |         |
| `/join`                         | `JoinGame`       | Player self-registration: game ID + name                                                                  |         |
| `/dashboard`                    | `DashBoard`      | No UI — resolves the GM's existing room or hosts a new one, then redirects                                | ✅      |
| `/rooms/:roomID/lobby`          | `Lobby`          | Roster management, target generation                                                                      | ✅      |
| `/rooms/:roomID/GameMasterView` | `GameMasterView` | The live game console                                                                                     | ✅      |
| `/rooms/:roomID/waiting`        | `PlayerGame`     | Continuous post-join screen: status line (waiting/target/eliminated) plus a live chat feed of GM messages | ✅      |

`NotFound` is the catch-all `*` route (`improvements.md` item 30).

### The `dbCalls.js` seam

`src/components/firebase_calls/dbCalls.js` is the single most important file in
the codebase. Every Firestore read and write goes through it (with two
exceptions noted below), which means it doubles as the **de facto schema
definition** — there is no other place where the shape of a player, task, or
room document is written down. See [data-model.md](./data-model.md).

Its naming convention is consistent and worth preserving:

- `fetch…ForRoom` / `fetch…ForPlayer` — reads that `await` and return data
- `fetch…QueryFor…` — returns an unexecuted Firestore `Query`, for the caller to
  hand to `onSnapshot`
- `update…For…` — writes

One file bypasses the seam and uses the Firestore SDK directly: `DashBoard.js`
(room creation). `src/utils/UnmapPlayers.js` used to be a second exception;
it was deleted when its unmapping logic moved server-side into `killPlayer`'s
transaction (item 4), which touches the Admin SDK directly — a different,
intentional exception, since it's server-side code in a separate package,
not a component reaching around `dbCalls.js`.

Most functions in `dbCalls.js` still wrap their body in `try/catch` and report
failures via `console.error`, then return `undefined`, and callers do not
check for this — a failed read commonly surfaces later as a `TypeError` on
`.docs[0]` or `.data()`. A representative subset (12 functions, and every one
of their call sites) now throws instead and is handled with `CreateAlert` at
the call site. This is a systemic pattern still mostly present, not an
oversight fully fixed in one place — see
[improvements.md item 10](./improvements.md).

### Components that are not components

Some files under `src/components/` export a factory that returns a function
rather than JSX. They are used like hooks but are not named like them:

| File              | Returns                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CreateAlert.js`  | `showToast(status, title, description, duration)`               |
| `RemapPlayers.js` | `handleRegeneration(needTargets, needAssassins, alive, roomID)` |

They are invoked as `const createAlert = CreateAlert();` at the top of a
component body. `CreateAlert` genuinely depends on a hook (`useToast()`);
`RemapPlayers` does not, and could be a plain module function.

`UnmapPlayers` used to be in this table too — a data-layer function
(`dbCalls.killPlayerForRoom`) called `UnmapPlayers()` at module-function
scope, a data-layer function reaching back into the component layer for a
factory pattern it never needed (it used no hooks; the doc's older claim
that it "genuinely depended on hooks or module state" was simply wrong).
Resolved by moving it to `src/utils/UnmapPlayers.js` as a plain exported
`handleUnmapping` function
([improvements.md item 16](./improvements.md)). That file was later deleted
outright when item 4 moved unmapping server-side into `killPlayer`'s
transaction, which re-implements it from scratch rather than calling the
old function.

## State management ✅ Resolved (improvements item 13)

There is no state library. Until item 13, state lived in three separate
places that did not agree with each other: `PlayersList`/`PhotosDisplay`
subscribed live via `onSnapshot`, `GameMasterView` fetched its own player/log
arrays once on mount and mutated them by hand, and the header's roster count
came from React Router location state (`useLocation().state.arrayOfPlayers`,
lost on reload — `Players (0)`).

`GameMasterView` now owns a single live `onSnapshot` subscription to the
same player query `PlayersList` used to subscribe to independently
(`fetchPlayersQueryByDescendPointsThenIsAliveForRoom`) and a second one for
the `logs` subcollection (`fetchLogsQueryByAscendingTimestampForRoom` — see
[data-model.md](./data-model.md), item 22). The header count
(`players.length`) and `ResetTargetsButton`'s alive-only roster
(`players.filter(p => p.isAlive).map(p => p.name)`) are both derived inline
from that one subscription — no separate state, no manual mutation.
`PlayersList` is presentational now, taking `players` as a prop instead of
subscribing itself (two live listeners on the same query would have doubled
the reads for no benefit). `completedTasks` remains write-only local state —
`TaskList` (item 15) owns its own independent live subscription to the
tasks collection rather than reading this. `arrayOfTasks`, the other
write-only piece this note used to describe, was deleted outright once item
15 restored the mission panel and made its uselessness obvious (its own
`fetchAllTasksForRoom` fetch, read by nothing).

### Contexts

`src/components/Contexts.js` declares three contexts with no default value and no
provider components. `gameContext` and `executionContext` providers are inlined
in `GameMasterView`'s JSX; `taskContext`'s provider lives inside
`TaskCreationModal.js` instead, wrapping `TaskCreation` only while the modal is
open.

| Context            | Provided value           | Consumers                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gameContext`      | `{ roomID }`             | `PlayersList`, `ChatInput`, `PhotosDisplay`, `HeaderExecution`, `Endgamebutton`, `ResetTargetsButton`, `TaskList`, `TaskCreation` |
| `executionContext` | 12 handler functions     | `ChatInput`, `PhotosDisplay`                                                                                                      |
| `taskContext`      | `{ handleNewTaskAdded }` | `TaskCreation`, reachable via `/mission start` opening `TaskCreationModal`                                                        |

`executionContext` is provided **twice** in `GameMasterView`'s tree with the same
object — once wrapping `ChatInput`, once wrapping the right-hand stack — because
the two consumers sit in different branches of the layout.

## Authentication and authorization

Three ways to sign in now: email/password (`src/components/auth.js`, shared
by `Login` and `SignUp` via an `isLoginPage` prop; password reset goes
through `sendPasswordResetEmail`), Google (`signInWithPopup` +
`googleProvider`, additive on the same `auth.js` form for the GM), and
anonymous/guest (`signInAnonymously`, used only by `JoinGame` — a player
never sees a login screen at all).

**Authorization is enforced at both the database and the route.**
`firestore.rules` (registered in `firebase.json`) scopes every read under
`rooms/{roomId}` — including all five subcollections — to whichever caller
is either the room's host (`resource.data.hostId == request.auth.uid`) or a
player who has joined it (`request.auth.uid` present in the room's
`joinedUids`, appended to by `joinRoom`) — not simply "any signed-in user"
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-join-flow-ui-and-room-scoping-design.md).
Writes stay host-only, unchanged. `rooms/{roomID}.hostId`, written once at
room creation, and `joinedUids`, appended to on every self-registration, are
both read by the rules engine via `get()`. A separate `allow list` grant
lets a host query `rooms` filtered to their own `hostId` — this is what
`DashBoard.js` uses to find a room they're already running instead of
creating a new one on every login
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-dashboard-removal-design.md); it's a
distinct grant because Firestore only allows a `list`/query operation when
the rule is provably true for every possible result of that exact query
shape, which a `get()`-based check like `isHostOfExistingRoom` can't
satisfy. On top of that,
`src/components/RequireAuth.js` wraps `/dashboard` and every `/rooms/:roomID/*`
route (including the new `/waiting`), redirecting a signed-out visitor to
`/` before the page renders at all — defense-in-depth, not a substitute for
the rules. `RequireAuth` accepts any signed-in user, anonymous included.

Gaps that remain, per [improvements.md](./improvements.md):

- `storage.rules` is path-scoped to `rooms/{roomId}/photos/**` and
  create-only (`resource == null`) since kill-photo submission, but not
  scoped per-room or per-player the way `firestore.rules` now is — any
  signed-in user can read/write within that path.
- All game logic remains client-side, so a signed-in host can still write any
  field on their own room's documents, including `score` directly — the rules
  stop other people from editing a room, not a host from writing anything to
  their own (item 4, item 10 in [testing.md](./testing.md#layer-2--security-rules-)).
- `photos` (Firestore) is scoped by the narrow `allow create` grant to
  `status: 'pending'`, `originalPlayerData: null` docs from any player of
  the room, not to a distinct per-photo-uploader identity — any player of
  a room can claim any name as the `assassin` field on a new photo doc,
  not just their own.

## Cloud Functions

`functions/` contains three callables and one scheduled function:

- `targetFunction` — a stub that checks `context.auth` and echoes its input
  back. Nothing in the game depends on it; its only caller, a debug button
  component (`cloudFunction.js`) that was never mounted anywhere, was
  deleted as dead code (`improvements.md` item 14).
- `killPlayer` (`functions/callableFunctions/killPlayer.js`) — the atomic
  replacement for the client-side kill flow (`improvements.md` item 4).
  Validates the kill, transfers points, marks the victim dead, unmaps them
  from every neighbor, and reassigns targets/assassins to whoever that
  leaves short, all inside one Firestore transaction via the Admin SDK.
  `src/components/executeKill.js` is now a thin `httpsCallable` wrapper
  around it. This is the one place in the app where game logic runs
  server-side rather than in the browser.
- `joinRoom` (`functions/callableFunctions/joinRoom.js`) — lets a player
  self-register into a room from their own device, atomically checking for
  a duplicate name and that the room is still in its Lobby phase, all
  inside one Firestore transaction via the Admin SDK — the player-facing
  counterpart to `dbCalls.addPlayerForRoom`
  (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-access-and-room-lifecycle-design.md).
  Also records the joining `uid` on the new player doc and appends it to
  the room's `joinedUids`, which is what `firestore.rules`' room-scoping
  checks against
  (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-join-flow-ui-and-room-scoping-design.md).
  `src/components/joinRoom.js` is its thin `httpsCallable` wrapper, same
  shape as `executeKill.js`. Unlike `killPlayer`, there is no host-only
  check — any signed-in caller (Google or anonymous/guest) may call it.
- `cleanupEndedRooms` (`functions/scheduledFunctions/cleanupEndedRooms.js`)
  — runs once every 24 hours, deleting any room (and everything under it)
  whose `endedAt` is older than a retention window. The window is a
  module-level constant, currently `1` (24 hours) — enough time to review
  standings and photos, or flag a mistake, before a room disappears
  (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-join-flow-ui-and-room-scoping-design.md).
  The first scheduled (as opposed to callable) function in this repo, and
  the first tested via `firebase-functions-test`'s `wrap()` rather than a
  client wrapper, since a cron job has no client caller to go through.

`functions/index.js` additionally constructs an Express app with CORS and then
never exports or uses it — pre-existing dead scaffolding, unrelated to
either callable.

**Kills are the one exception; everything else is still client-side.**
Target _generation_ (the initial ring assignment), open-season toggling,
task-completion scoring, and reviving a player all still execute in the
browser and write directly to Firestore, same as before. `firestore.rules`
(item 2) scopes those writes to the room's host, but does not distinguish
_which_ field a host writes — a signed-in host can still write a player's
score directly, for anything that isn't a kill. See `firestore.rules`'s own
header comment and `improvements.md` item 4's resolution for the exact
boundary of what moved server-side and what didn't.

`functions/` is a separate npm package sharing the root's dependency tree
via npm workspaces (`package.json`'s `"workspaces": ["functions"]`) — a
single `npm install` at the repo root installs both. `killPlayer.js` reuses
`src/game/remapPlan.js` (and its own dependencies, `targetGraph.js` and
`playerNames.js`) directly via a relative `require()` — those three files
use CommonJS `module.exports` rather than this codebase's usual ES
`export`/`import` specifically so a plain Node `require()` from `functions/`
works with no build step; the client's existing `import` of them is
unaffected (webpack's CommonJS interop). `joinRoom.js` reuses
`playerNames.js` the same way, for the same reason.

## Configuration and environments

`src/utils/firebase.js` reads six `REACT_APP_*` variables from `.env` and, when
`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`, connects all four SDKs to local
emulators:

| Emulator  | Port (`firebase.json`) | Client (`utils/firebase.js`) |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Auth      | 9099                   | 9099                         |
| Functions | 5001                   | 5001                         |
| Firestore | 8081                   | 8081                         |
| Storage   | 9199                   | 9199                         |

`NODE_ENV` is set to `development` by `react-scripts start`, so **`npm start`
always targets emulators** and `npm run build` always targets production. There
is no way to run the dev server against the real project without editing code.

`.firebaserc` maps `default`, `dev`, and `prod` aliases all to the same project
ID, `mall-mystery-heroes`. There is no environment separation.

`firebase.json` configures functions, emulators, storage rules, and hosting.
`npm run build` produces `build/`, which `firebase.json`'s `hosting.public`
points at; `firebase deploy --only hosting` ships it.

`hosting.headers` explicitly overrides Firebase Hosting's default
`Cache-Control: max-age=3600` on `index.html` (the SPA shell every route
rewrites to) down to `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` — without this, a
browser or Firebase's own CDN edge can keep serving the _previous_ deploy's
`index.html` (referencing the previous build's hashed JS/CSS filenames) for
up to an hour after a new deploy, making a shipped fix look like it never
went out. The hashed `/static/**` assets get the opposite treatment
(`max-age=31536000, immutable`) — safe, since a changed file always gets a
new content-hashed filename.

**`firestore.rules`, `functions`, and `hosting` must be deployed together.**
`/join` calls the `joinRoom` Cloud Function, and the room-scoping rules'
`isHostOfExistingRoom`/`isPlayerOfRoom` checks depend on `joinedUids`, which
only `joinRoom` writes — deploying one without the other leaves the Join
flow broken (the callable doesn't exist, or a joined player still can't read
their own room). As of this writing, Hosting has been deployed several
times but Functions never has, so this ordering is not yet a solved
problem, only a documented one.

## Build and test tooling

Create React App 5 (`react-scripts`), Chakra UI 2 for all styling (no CSS
modules; `App.css`/`index.css` are near-empty), React Router 6.

`jest.config.js` and `babel.config.js` configure a full Jest + Testing
Library + jsdom stack. `npm test` runs `jest --selectProjects unit dom`
directly (not `react-scripts test`), so it does read `jest.config.js`. See
[testing.md](./testing.md) for the current suite — this note used to say
"there are no test files," which stopped being true a long time ago and was
never updated.
