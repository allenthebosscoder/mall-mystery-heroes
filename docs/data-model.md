# Firestore data model

There is no schema declaration anywhere in the codebase — no rules file, no
converters, no TypeScript types. This document is reconstructed from the call
sites in `src/components/firebase_calls/dbCalls.js` and is the only written
record of the shape of the data.

Everything is scoped under a single top-level collection:

```
rooms/{roomID}
  ├─ players/{trimmedNameLowerCase}
  ├─ tasks/{autoId}
  ├─ photos/{autoId}
  └─ logs/{autoId}
```

`roomID` is a human-readable document ID, not an auto-ID — see
[Room ID generation](#room-id-generation).

---

## `rooms/{roomID}`

The room document holds game-wide state. Chat logs live in a subcollection
(below), not on this document.

## `rooms/{roomID}/logs/{autoId}` ✅ Resolved (improvements item 22)

The chat/event log. One document per entry — until this item, `logs` was an
array field on the room document itself, appended with `arrayUnion`. Two
problems followed from that: Firestore's 1 MiB document limit capped a
game's total log history and every message rewrote the whole document, and
`arrayUnion` deduplicates by deep equality, so two identical messages in the
same second (same `time`/`log`/`color`) silently collapsed into one.

| Field       | Type        | Notes                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time`      | `string`    | e.g. `"3:42:07 PM"`, from `Date#toLocaleTimeString()`. Display only.       |
| `log`       | `string`    | The message text.                                                          |
| `color`     | `string`    | A Chakra color token (e.g. `"red.400"`) or a raw CSS color.                |
| `timestamp` | `Timestamp` | `serverTimestamp()`. Used only for `orderBy` — mirrors `photos.timestamp`. |

Written by `dbCalls.addLogForRoom` (an `addDoc`, replacing the old
`updateLogsForRoom`'s `updateDoc` + `arrayUnion`). Read by
`GameMasterView` via a live `onSnapshot` subscription on
`fetchLogsQueryByAscendingTimestampForRoom`, not a one-time fetch — see
[improvements.md item 13](./improvements.md) for why that matters (a second
GM's log entries are no longer invisible until reload).

## `rooms/{roomID}/players/{trimmedNameLowerCase}`

One document per player. Created by the `joinRoom` Cloud Function
(`functions/callableFunctions/joinRoom.js`), which runs the duplicate
check and the write in a single Firestore transaction keyed on the
document ID — this is what makes two concurrent joins under the same name
safe (one succeeds, one rejects). `dbCalls.fetchPlayerReferenceForRoom`
(used by `PlayerGame.js` to live-subscribe to a player's own doc) also
builds this same ID directly from the player's name, so the ID scheme is a
public contract, not just an implementation detail of `joinRoom`. Before
the 2026-08-14 simplified-lobby redesign, players could also be created by
a GM's manual "Add Player" form (`dbCalls.addPlayerForRoom`, since deleted
— docs/improvements.md item 47) using the same ID scheme; that path no
longer exists, so every player doc today is created by `joinRoom` and
carries a `uid`. Player docs created before either change keep their old
auto-generated IDs; those are invisible to `fetchPlayerReferenceForRoom`'s
by-ID lookup, so such a player would not get a live player-doc

Historically absent on GM-added players, created via the now-deleted `dbCalls.addPlayerForRoom` before the 2026-08-14 simplified-lobby redesign removed the manual-add UI; every player doc today is created by `joinRoom` and carries a `uid` (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-join-flow-ui-and-room-scoping-design.md). |

**One `uid` is not guaranteed to own only one player doc in a room.**
`joinRoom` checks that the _name_ is free, not that the joining `uid` is
new to the room, so the same person joining twice under two names ends up
with two player docs sharing a `uid` (docs/improvements.md item 66).
`submitKillPhoto`/`submitChatMessage` reject such a caller outright rather
than guessing which doc is "them"; `Homepage.js`'s session recovery, whose
collection-group query legitimately spans rooms, prefers a candidate whose
room is still `isGameActive`.

### The target graph

`targets` and `assassins` are two directed adjacency lists that must stay
mutually consistent: if `A.targets` contains `B`, then `B.assassins` must
contain `A`. Nothing enforces this at the schema level. Three separate code
paths maintain it:

- `TargetGenerator` (initial assignment, in the lobby) — writes players one
  at a time, no batch or transaction.
- `ResetTargetsButton` (hard reset mid-game — a near-verbatim copy of the
  above) — same caveat.
- `RemapPlayers` (incremental repair after a revival; used to also run after
  a kill, before item 4) — same caveat.

Kills are the exception: `functions/callableFunctions/killPlayer.js`
(improvements item 4) does the removal-from-the-graph step that used to be
`UnmapPlayers` (deleted) and the post-kill remap step that used to be a
separate `RemapPlayers` call, both inside one Firestore transaction. A
partial write is no longer possible for a kill specifically — either the
whole graph update lands or none of it does. `TargetGenerator`,
`ResetTargetsButton`, and `RemapPlayers`'s remaining caller (`/revive`) are
still one-write-at-a-time and can still leave the two lists disagreeing if
interrupted.

`targetsLength`/`assassinsLength` used to exist here as a denormalized
`array.length`, so Firestore queries could `orderBy` array size — removed
entirely (improvements item 9). Nothing had read them since `RemapPlayers`
moved to in-memory matching via `planRemap` (item 17); the two
`fetchAlivePlayersByAscend…LengthForRoom` functions that queried by them
were confirmed-dead code, and `killPlayer` (item 4) never maintained them in
the first place, so every kill was already leaving them stale. Deleting the
fields removes the drift rather than chasing every writer.

### Name casing ✅ Resolved (improvements item 1)

Stored names preserve the GM's capitalization. Every lookup in `dbCalls.js`
now queries `trimmedNameLowerCase`, and `ChatInput.js`'s comparisons against
arrays that come back case-preserved (`fetchPlayersByStatusForRoom`)
normalize both sides before comparing — so a player named `Alice` can be
referenced from the command bar as `alice`. `killPlayer.js` (the Cloud
Function, `improvements.md` item 4) does the same normalization on the
server side for kills specifically.

Not covered: `trimmedNameLowerCase` strips all whitespace, but `ChatInput`'s
`.toLowerCase()` calls don't strip any, so a multi-word bracketed name like
`[Alice Smith]` can still mismatch. See
[improvements.md item 35](./improvements.md).

## `rooms/{roomID}/tasks/{autoId}`

Missions the GM sets for players. Created by `TaskCreation` via
`dbCalls.addTaskForRoom`, edited by `TaskEditModal` via
`dbCalls.updateTaskForRoom`, and deleted by `TaskAccordion` via
`dbCalls.deleteTaskForRoom` — the collection has all three write paths as of
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-mission-edit-delete-design.md`. Editing a
mission's `pointValue` after players have completed it also writes each
completing player's `score` (`rooms/{roomID}/players/{trimmedNameLowerCase}`
above), via `dbCalls.updatePointsForPlayer` once per name in `completedBy` —
the delta is decided by `src/game/missionEdit.js`'s `planScoreAdjustment` and
applied only after the GM confirms it. Not a transaction: the mission write
and the per-player increments are separate, sequential writes.

`taskType` decides the completion effect:

- **`Task`** — awards `parseInt(pointValue)` to the player.
- **`Revival Mission`** — brings the player back to life and triggers a remap.
  `pointValue` is forced to `0` and the input is disabled in the UI.

Creation and listing are reachable from the GM console again as of
`improvements.md` item 15 — missions used to only be completable via the
command bar (`/mission done`/`/mission end`), with no way to create one
through the app at all. Both now open as on-demand popups,
`TaskCreationModal`/`TaskListModal`, via `/mission start`/`/mission view` —
not a permanently-visible panel.

## `rooms/{roomID}/photos/{autoId}`

Kill-proof photos, written by a player claiming a kill — the `submitKillPhoto` Cloud Function
(`functions/callableFunctions/submitKillPhoto.js`), called from
`MessageComposer.js` through the thin `httpsCallable` wrapper
`src/components/submitKillPhoto.js` after the photo is uploaded to Storage
via `storageCalls.uploadKillPhoto`
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-kill-photo-submission-design.md,
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-identity-verified-player-writes-design.md).
The client no longer writes here at all: `dbCalls.addPhotoForRoom` and
`firestore.rules`' player-facing `photos` `allow create` clause are both
deleted, and the function runs under the Admin SDK, which bypasses rules
entirely — so the function _is_ the enforcement now.

What it enforces, all server-side: the caller must be a player of this
room (matched by their own `uid`, not by any name they send), the game
must still be active, `status`/`target`/`originalPlayerData` are hardcoded
rather than accepted from the client, and the `url` must be a legitimate
download URL for this room's own Storage path. `submitKillPhoto` does not
take a `target` argument at all — a player no longer names who they
killed (everyone in the game knows each other, and an ambiguous photo is
already an automatic fail per the game's own rules), so `target` is
always `null` at submission; a moderator resolves it later, in
`PhotosDisplay.js`, from the assassin's own live `targets` list. The `url`
check moved out of
`firestore.rules` and into `src/game/killPhotoUrl.js`'s
`isValidKillPhotoUrl` (vendored into `functions/vendor/game/` by
`functions/scripts/sync-shared-game-logic.js`), unchanged in substance: the
whole string must begin with an allowed Storage origin
(`https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com` in production, or
`http://localhost:9199` — what `getDownloadURL` actually returns against
the Storage emulator) and then carry
`/v0/b/{bucket}/o/rooms%2F{roomID}%2Fphotos%2F`, this room's own
percent-encoded object path. The bucket segment stays a wildcard because
production and the emulator use different buckets
(docs/improvements.md item 60). Submissions are also rate-limited per
player — see `rateLimits` in the `players` table above. A caller whose
`uid` matches more than one player doc in the room is rejected outright
rather than attributed to whichever doc sorts first (docs/improvements.md
item 66).

The host's own writes to this collection (approve/deny/undo, via
`dbCalls`) are unaffected by any of the above — they still go through the
client SDK under `firestore.rules`' `allow write: if isHostOfExistingRoom`.

| `originalPlayerData`  | `{ [trimmedNameLowerCase]: { score, targets, assassins, isAlive, openSeason } }` | Written by `killPlayer`'s `preKillSnapshot` return value, persisted via `dbCalls.approvePhotoForRoom` only when `status` becomes `'approved'`.

`PhotosDisplay` reads every photo document in the room on every snapshot and
splits them client-side by `status` (`src/game/photoJudgments.js`,
`splitPhotosByStatus`) — `pending` into the judgment queue, `approved`/`denied`
into undo history. Neither split is part of the query. Because both are
derived fresh from Firestore on every snapshot rather than accumulated
locally, `originalPlayerData` is what makes undo survive a page reload
(docs/improvements.md item 6) — before it existed, the snapshot needed to
revert a kill lived only in React state and was lost on reload even though
the photo document itself was already durably `approved`. Originally this
snapshot covered only the target and was replayed by several separate
client-side writes; the 2026-08-16 full-kill-undo redesign
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-full-kill-undo-design.md`) widened it to
every touched player and moved the replay itself server-side, into
`undoKillPlayer`, so an undo is atomic the same way a kill already was.

## `rooms/{roomID}/playerMessages/{autoId}`

Player-facing messages from `/whisper`, `/broadcast`, and `/leaderboard`
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-messaging-mobile-prep-design.md).
**Designed to be read by a player-facing mobile app**, not by this
codebase — unlike `photos` above, which now has a real in-app writer
(`MessageComposer.js`), nothing in this codebase reads `playerMessages`
except `MessageFeed.js`/`GMChatPanel.js`, both entirely separate from
whatever a future mobile app might eventually read this collection for.
`MessageFeed.js` now reads
`playerMessages` via `fetchPlayerMessagesQueryForRoom`, filtering to broadcasts/leaderboard sends
and whispers addressed to the subscribing player. `'broadcast'` writes also
now come from game-event handlers in `GameMasterView.js` and
`ChatInput.js` (kills, revives, open season, missions), not just the
explicit `/broadcast` command.

`'chat'` is the exception to "read by a mobile app, not this codebase" above,
on both ends
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-chat-send-and-efficiency-design.md):
`MessageComposer.js` sends it from a player's browser session, and
`GMChatPanel.js` reads it back for the GM console, filtering client-side to
`type: 'chat'` the same way `MessageFeed.js` filters to
whisper/broadcast/leaderboard/mission. That same change bounded
`fetchPlayerMessagesQueryForRoom` to the newest 50 messages
(`limitToLast(50)`), so a long-running game's chat traffic doesn't grow the
read on every feed/panel subscription without bound.

`'chat'` messages are written by the `submitChatMessage` Cloud Function
(`functions/callableFunctions/submitChatMessage.js`), which
`MessageComposer.js` calls through the thin `httpsCallable` wrapper
`src/components/submitChatMessage.js`
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-identity-verified-player-writes-design.md).
The client no longer writes here: `dbCalls.addChatMessageForRoom` and
`firestore.rules`' player-facing `'chat'`-scoped `allow create` grant are
both deleted, and the function runs under the Admin SDK, which bypasses
rules entirely. It enforces that the caller is a player of this room
(matched by their own `uid`) and that `text` is a string of 500
characters or fewer (the same cap
`MessageComposer.js`'s `maxLength={500}` applies in the UI —
docs/improvements.md item 57), and a per-player rate limit (see
`rateLimits` in the `players` table above). It sets `type`, `recipient`,
`standings`, `mission`, and `sender` itself; only `text` comes from the
client. A caller whose `uid` matches more than one player doc in the room
is rejected outright rather than attributed to whichever doc sorts first
(docs/improvements.md item 66).

**GM-originated messages are entirely unaffected by that.**
`'broadcast'`/`'whisper'`/`'leaderboard'`/`'mission'` writes still go
through `dbCalls.addPlayerMessageForRoom` from the GM console, authorized
by `firestore.rules`' host-only `allow write: if isHostOfExistingRoom` —
that path was never moved server-side and never wrote `type: 'chat'`.

`'killPhoto'` and `'killResult'` announce a kill attempt and its outcome
in the same room-wide feed, so every player sees the attempt as it
happens rather than only the assassin. `'killPhoto'` is written by
`submitKillPhoto.js` (Admin SDK, same transaction as the `photos` doc
itself) the moment a player submits — this doubles as the assassin's own
confirmation that the submission went through, so no separate private
notice exists; it renders as a plain chat-style post (sender name, photo,
timestamp — `MessageBubble.js`), naming no target, since one hasn't been
resolved yet. `'killResult'` is written by `PhotosDisplay.js`'s
`handlePass`/`handleDeny`, via the same `dbCalls.addPlayerMessageForRoom`
path GM broadcasts already use, right after a moderator approves or
denies — both outcomes are announced, including a denial (deliberately:
the target can see in chat that someone specifically tried and failed) —
though a denial's announcement never names a target either, for the same
reason `'killPhoto'` doesn't: denying never requires resolving one.
`handleUndo` posts a `'killResult'` message the same way when a moderator
reverses either judgment (`outcome: 'undoneApproval'`/`'undoneDenial'`),
reusing the exact text already written to the GM's own log for that undo.

`'gameEnded'` and `'gameEndedLeaderboard'` are both written once,
together, by `Endgamebutton.js`'s `onYesEnd`, right after `dbCalls.endGame`
succeeds — the game genuinely has ended by the time either is posted, so a
failure posting them surfaces as a GM-facing alert but never blocks
navigation. `'gameEnded'` carries the fixed "Please head back to the
starting area." announcement; `MessageFeed.js` pulls it out of the normal
scrolling list and renders it pinned above the feed, so it stays visible
regardless of how much chat happens afterward — the one message type this
collection has that behaves this way. `'gameEndedLeaderboard'` carries the
full final standings (`buildLeaderboardStandings` over every player,
alive and dead) and renders inline in the normal scrolling feed, via
`GameEndedLeaderboardBubble.js`, showing just the top 3 plus a "View Full
Leaderboard" button that opens the same `LeaderboardModal.js` the deleted
`GameOverScreen.js` used to own. Chat itself stays open after the game
ends (`submitChatMessage.js` is deliberately not gated on `isGameActive`)

(`submitKillPhoto.js`'s own `isGameActive` check, unchanged) and in the
UI (`MessageComposer.js`'s camera button, gated on a new `isGameActive`
prop `PlayerGame.js` passes through).

This is display-cased, **not** the `trimmedNameLowerCase` key player documents are keyed by (e.g. `"alicesmith"`). A reader matching `recipient` against a specific player must apply this repo's `normalizePlayerName` (`src/game/playerNames.js`, see docs/improvements.md item 35) to both sides before comparing — it strips _all_ whitespace, not just leading/trailing, so a plain `.toLowerCase()` will fail to match names with internal spaces. |

## `rooms/{roomID}/reconnectRequests/{autoId}`

Pending requests from a player whose device is signed in under a
different uid than the one that originally joined, asking to reclaim an
existing name once the game has started — written by the
`requestReconnect` Cloud Function
(`functions/callableFunctions/reconnectRequest.js`), judged by the host
via `approveReconnectRequest`/`denyReconnectRequest`
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-player-reconnect-design.md). All three
run under the Admin SDK, which bypasses `firestore.rules` entirely —
`firestore.rules`' `reconnectRequests` match block has no player-facing
`allow create` at all, unlike `photos`/`playerMessages`, which at least
had one once (see those sections above).

| Field                  | Type                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |

| `playerName`           | `string`                              | The existing player's real stored-casing `name`, copied from their player document at request time.                                                    |
| `trimmedNameLowerCase` | `string`                              | The lookup key — same scheme every player document ID already uses. `approveReconnectRequest` re-reads the player document by this field, not by name. |
| `requestingUid`        | `string`                              | The new device's `context.auth.uid`. Written to the player document's own `uid` field, and added to the room's `joinedUids`, only once approved.       |
| `status`               | `'pending' \| 'approved' \| 'denied'` | Set once, never reverted — a resolved request cannot be re-judged; a fresh reconnect attempt creates a new request document instead.                   |
| `timestamp`            | `Timestamp`                           | `serverTimestamp()`, set once at creation.                                                                                                             |

`firestore.rules`' `reconnectRequests` `allow read` grant lets the
requester read their own request (`resource.data.requestingUid ==
request.auth.uid`) and lets the host read/list every request for their
room — nobody else can read this collection at all, and no client write
is ever permitted (`allow write: if false`).

Approving a reconnect adds the new uid to `joinedUids` but never removes
the superseded old one — the old device keeps read access to the room (it
can no longer write anything, since every write path resolves the player
by a `where('uid', '==', ...)` query that will no longer match it, the old
uid having been overwritten on the player doc). This matches the same
accepted behavior `removePlayer.js`'s `removeAndRemap` already has (it
deletes the player doc without touching `joinedUids` either). Blind
pruning isn't safe here — the old uid could legitimately still be a
different, unrelated player in some future scenario — so this is a
deliberate trade-off, not an oversight.

## Room cleanup

`functions/scheduledFunctions/cleanupEndedRooms.js` runs once every 24
hours and deletes any room whose `endedAt` is older than a retention
window. The window is a module-level `let RETENTION_DAYS`, currently `1`
day — enough time to review standings, kill photos, and flag any
last-minute mistake before a room's data disappears
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-access-and-room-lifecycle-design.md).
For each expired room, it first deletes that room's Firebase Storage
photos (`rooms/{roomId}/photos/**`, see the Firebase Storage section
below) and only then deletes everything under the room in Firestore —
players, logs, tasks, photos, playerMessages — via the Admin SDK's
`recursiveDelete()`. The Storage delete is wrapped in its own
`try`/`catch`: if it fails, that room is skipped for this run (its
Firestore data stays in place, so the next scheduled run retries both
operations) without blocking cleanup of any other expired room in the
same invocation (docs/improvements.md item 61).
A room that's abandoned mid-lobby and never explicitly ended (`endedAt`
never set) is not covered by this and is never automatically deleted.

## Firebase Storage

`storage.rules` is path-scoped to `rooms/{roomId}/photos/**` (kill-photo
submission) — a signed-in user may read/write within that path, and
`allow write` also requires `resource == null`, i.e. only a fresh object
path, not overwriting/deleting one that already exists. Nothing outside
that path is reachable. Not scoped per-room/per-host beyond the path
match, since there's no per-player auth identity yet to scope a write to;
see the rules file's own header comment.

`storageCalls.js` (`uploadKillPhoto`) is the module that uses it — it
uploads a kill-photo `Blob` to `rooms/{roomID}/photos/{crypto.randomUUID()}.jpg`
and returns its download URL, which `addPhotoForRoom` then writes onto the
`photos` document (see above). This is a re-add of the file: an earlier,
unrelated `storageCalls.js` (a broken `fetchPhotoURLFromStorageForRoom`
with no callers) was deleted as dead code (`improvements.md` item 14);
this is a new module, added for kill-photo submission.

On the deletion side, `cleanupEndedRooms.js` now deletes a room's
`rooms/{roomId}/photos/**` objects via `bucket.deleteFiles({ prefix })` as
part of its scheduled cleanup pass — see the Room cleanup section above.

## Room ID generation

`DashBoard.handleHostRoom` builds an ID with `unique-names-generator`:

```js
uniqueNamesGenerator({
    dictionaries: [adjectives, [randomRoomNumber.toString()]], // 10000–99999
    separator: '',
    style: 'capital',
});
```

producing IDs like `Fluffy42317`. It retries on collision (checked with
`checkForRoomIDDupes`) up to 300 attempts before giving up with a toast. The
check-then-write is not atomic, so two simultaneous hosts can in principle claim
the same ID.

## Unused data-layer surface ✅ Resolved (improvements item 14)

`createRoomWithDefaults`, `addPhotoForRoom`, `updateCompletedByForTask`,
`fetchTaskForRoom`, `fetchReferenceForTask`, `updateIsCompleteToTrueForTask`,
and `fetchAlivePlayersQueryByDescendPointsForRoom` — the seven `dbCalls.js`
exports with no live callers this section used to list — have been deleted.
See [improvements.md item 14](./improvements.md) for what each was
superseded by, including the `createRoomWithDefaults` vs. `DashBoard`'s
inline `setDoc` disagreement over `taskIndex`'s starting value.
