# Game flows

Sequence diagrams for the four flows that matter. Killing a player (flow 2),
completing a mission and its undo (flows 3 and 4), and kill-undo (flow 3) all
run server-side, inside a Cloud Function (`improvements.md` item 4,
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-mission-undo-design.md); everything else
shown still runs in the browser.

## 1. Hosting a room and starting a game

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor GM
    participant DB as DashBoard
    participant Lobby
    participant TG as TargetGenerator
    participant FS as Firestore

    GM->>DB: sign in
    DB->>FS: fetchActiveRoomForHost(uid)
    alt active room already exists, gameStarted
        DB->>DB: navigate(/rooms/{roomID}/GameMasterView)
    else active room exists, not yet started
        DB->>Lobby: navigate(/rooms/{roomID}/lobby)
    else no active room for this host
        loop until unique, max 300 tries
            DB->>DB: uniqueNamesGenerator() → "Fluffy42317"
            DB->>FS: checkForRoomIDDupes(roomID)
        end
        DB->>FS: setDoc(rooms/{roomID}, {hostId, isGameActive, gameStarted, joinedUids:[], taskIndex:1, storageReference:[], createdAt})
        DB->>Lobby: navigate(/rooms/{roomID}/lobby)
    end

    Note over Lobby: players arrive via the separate self-service joinRoom flow, live via onSnapshot — not shown in this loop
    loop roster management
        GM->>Lobby: remove player
        Lobby->>FS: removePlayerForRoom
    end

    GM->>TG: "Begin Game"
    TG->>TG: buildTargetGraph(players) — pure client-side graph build
    TG-->>GM: preview dialog of every player's targets
    GM->>TG: "Confirm and Begin Game"
    TG->>FS: markGameAsStarted(roomID) — gameStarted: true
    loop per player
        TG->>FS: updateTargetsForPlayer(player, targets)
        TG->>FS: updateAssassinsForPlayer(player, assassins)
    end
    TG->>Lobby: handleLobbyRoom()
    Lobby->>Lobby: navigate(/rooms/{roomID}/GameMasterView)
```

Two things to note:

- The guard is `arrayOfPlayers.length <= 1`, so a game can start with two
  players — `maxTargetsFor` (below) clamps each player's target count down
  for a small roster rather than refusing to start.
- `GameMasterView` no longer receives the roster via router state — it
  subscribes live via `onSnapshot` (`docs/improvements.md` item 13), so a
  reload no longer loses it.

### The target assignment algorithm

`buildTargetGraph` (`src/game/targetGraph.js`) builds the graph like this:

```
maxTargetsFor(playerCount) = clamp(playerCount > 15 ? 3 : playerCount > 5 ? 2 : 1, 0, playerCount - 1)

shuffle the roster (Fisher–Yates/Durstenfeld, on a copy)
lay the shuffled roster out in a ring
for each player P at ring position i:
    for step in 1..maxTargets:
        P hunts the player at ring position (i + step) % count
```

This is a true ring construction, not a search: every player gets exactly
`maxTargets` targets and `maxTargets` assassins, by construction, with no
self-targeting and (whenever `2 * maxTargets < playerCount`) no mutual
pairs. `TargetGenerator.js` and `ResetTargetsButton.js` both call this
same shared function — it replaced two ~120-line duplicate
implementations, plus a differently-shaped third copy in `RemapPlayers.js`
(`docs/improvements.md` item 11).

It replaced `TargetGenerator.InitializeTargets`, a randomized ring-walk
that could abandon a slot when its search wrapped all the way around,
leaving players with fewer than `MAXTARGETS` targets and a graph that
could fracture into disjoint sub-games — and `randomizeArray`, a subtly
incorrect Fisher–Yates that iterated forward while drawing `j` from
`[0, i]`, which does not produce a uniform permutation
(`docs/improvements.md` item 12).

`functions/callableFunctions/killPlayer.js` and `joinRoom.js` also depend
on this file, via a vendored copy — see "Keeping the Cloud Functions
self-contained" below.

---

## 2. Killing a player (`/kill target assassin`)

Resolved by `improvements.md` item 4. What used to be ~15 sequential,
unbatched Firestore round trips from the browser is now a single
`httpsCallable` request to a Cloud Function, `killPlayer`, which does
everything inside one Firestore transaction.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor GM
    participant CI as ChatInput
    participant EK as executeKill (client)
    participant KP as killPlayer (Cloud Function)
    participant FS as Firestore

    GM->>CI: /kill alice bob
    CI->>CI: fetchAllPlayersForRoom → validate both names locally
    CI->>EK: executeKill(target, assassin, roomID)
    EK->>KP: httpsCallable('killPlayer', {target, assassin, roomId})

    KP->>FS: runTransaction: read room (host check), assassin, target, neighbors, alive roster
    alt target not in assassin's list AND neither has open season
        KP-->>EK: HttpsError('failed-precondition', ...)
        EK-->>CI: rejected promise
        CI-->>GM: error toast, stop
    end
    Note over KP: decide phase — transfer score,<br/>mark target dead, scrub target from<br/>every neighbour's targets/assassins,<br/>plan replacement targets/assassins (planRemap)
    KP->>FS: one transaction.update() per affected player doc
    KP-->>EK: {targetWasOpenSzn, preKillSnapshot, addedTargets, addedAssassins, remapLogs}

    EK-->>CI: same response
    CI->>CI: handleKillPlayer(...) → local state + log
    CI->>CI: handleRemapping(log) for each remapLogs entry
    CI->>CI: handleAddNewTargets / handleAddNewAssassins
```

**Scoring.** The assassin receives the victim's _entire_ score (floored at 0),
and the victim's score is zeroed. Since everyone starts at 10, points concentrate
as the game progresses. Unchanged by item 4 — only where it runs changed.

**Open season.** The three-way rule is: the target is on the assassin's list,
OR the target has open season on themself, OR the assassin has open season
(blanket rights). `killPlayer` reads both `assassinData.openSeason` and
`targetData.openSeason` directly inside the transaction — the confusing
assassin/victim mixup the old client code had (checking the assassin's flag
but logging as if it were the victim's) is gone along with the code that had
it, since `targetWasOpenSzn` returned to the client is always read from the
target's own document.

**Atomicity.** No longer independent writes — either the whole transaction
lands (score transfer, victim marked dead, every neighbour unmapped, every
orphaned player remapped) or none of it does. A network failure partway
through can no longer leave the target graph half-repaired.

### Remapping

Folded into the same transaction as the kill itself, not a separate
client-driven step. `killPlayer` calls the same pure `planRemap`
(`src/game/remapPlan.js`) the old `RemapPlayers.handleRegeneration` used,
but against an in-memory roster read once in the transaction's read phase
(with the about-to-die target filtered out and scrubbed from every
neighbour's arrays, since a transaction's writes haven't landed yet when the
roster is read) rather than one Firestore document fetched per candidate.

`RemapPlayers.js` itself still exists and is still used for `/revive` — see
flow 4 — where the same one-write-at-a-time caveat described in
`improvements.md` item 17 still applies.

### Keeping the Cloud Functions self-contained

`killPlayer.js` requires `../vendor/game/remapPlan` and
`../vendor/game/playerNames`; `joinRoom.js` requires
`../vendor/game/playerNames`. Neither requires `../vendor/game/targetGraph`
directly — `remapPlan.js` itself requires it, so it's vendored
transitively for `killPlayer.js`'s sake. All three are vendored rather
than reaching into `src/game/` directly. Firebase's functions deploy uploads
only the `functions/` directory in isolation, so a `require()` reaching
outside it resolves fine locally and under the emulator (both run from
the full repo checkout) but cannot resolve in the actual deployed bundle.
`functions/scripts/sync-shared-game-logic.js` copies the specific
`src/game/` modules these two functions depend on into the gitignored
`functions/vendor/game/` — run automatically before every deploy
(`firebase.json`'s `functions[0].predeploy`) and before
`npm run test:emulator`, which exercises the same require paths the real
deploy uses. `src/game/` stays the single source of truth;
`functions/vendor/` is a regenerated build artifact, never hand-edited or
committed.

## 3. Photo moderation

The mobile app writes a `pending` photo; the GM judges it from the console.
**Aspirational** — no such app exists yet (`improvements.md` item 33), so
this flow has no way to start today except manual/emulator seeding of a
`photos` document.

        UMPA->>UMPACF: httpsCallable('undoMissionPhotoApproval', {roomId, photoId})
        Note over UMPACF: one transaction: verifies the photo is an approved<br/>mission completion with a missionUndoSnapshot (rejects a<br/>pre-mission-undo photo that predates that field), restores<br/>every snapshotted player verbatim, removes the player from<br/>completedBy (un-sets isComplete if auto-ended), then resets<br/>the photo's status/mission/missionUndoSnapshot
        UMPACF-->>UMPA: (void)
        UMPA-->>PD: resolved promise
        PD->>FS: addLog("Undo: the last mission completion was reverted")
    else Undo last judgment, previous action was Deny

        PD->>FS: updatePhotoStatusForRoom("pending")
        PD->>FS: addLog("Undo: denial of assassin's claim on target was reverted.")
    end
```

**The target/mission claim now comes from the photo document itself, set
by the player at submission time, not picked by the GM at approval time**
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-player-selects-target-mission-design.md`).
`PhotosDisplay` no longer computes any options or shows a picker — it
reads `target`/`mission` straight off the current photo and displays them
("assassin's kill attempt on target" / "assassin's mission attempt:
title"). Approve calls `executeKill`/`completeMission` with those
already-known values; both still independently re-validate the claim
against live game state exactly as they did before, so a claim that's
gone stale by review time still fails cleanly rather than being approved
anyway.

`PhotosDisplay` calls the exact same `executeKill` (and therefore the same
`killPlayer` Cloud Function) `/kill` does — resolved by `improvements.md`
item 5, then item 4 moved what `executeKill` does server-side. This closed
what used to be two real gaps between the photo-approval path and `/kill`:
approving a photo now validates the target the same way `/kill` does, and now
remaps orphaned players the same way `/kill` does, since both call the same
function. `preKillSnapshot` — a map keyed by normalized player name, each
value `{score, targets, assassins, isAlive, openSeason}`, one entry per
player `killPlayer`'s transaction touched (target, killer, and anyone the
remap reassigned) — is persisted onto the photo document itself
(`approvePhotoForRoom`) rather than kept only in React state, which is what
makes Undo survive a reload (`improvements.md` item 6).

**Open-season-ended announcement.** `killPlayer` always clears
`openSeason` server-side inside its own transaction when the killed target
had it set, regardless of which path triggered the kill. `PhotosDisplay`'s
`handlePass` reads `targetWasOpenSzn` back from `executeKill`'s response
and, when true, calls `handleOpenSznended(target)` before announcing the
kill itself — the same GM-console log/broadcast pair
(`'open season has ended for <target>'`) the typed `/kill` command already
triggers via `GameMasterView.js`'s own `handleOpenSznended` call. Before
this, the photo-approval path silently ended open season without ever
telling anyone.

Approving a photo as a mission instead of a kill calls the exact same
server-side `completeMission` Cloud Function (and, underneath it, the same
`planMissionCompletion` decision logic) that `/mission done` calls — see flow
4 — so a mission completion behaves identically no matter which of the two
paths triggered it, and each caller persists its own `reversalSnapshot` for
later undo (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-mission-completion-via-photo-design.md,
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-mission-undo-design.md). Undoing a
mission-approved photo is likewise a single atomic Cloud Function call —
`undoMissionPhotoApproval` — mirroring how `undoKillPlayer` already undoes
an approved kill; it is a photo-anchored undo stack, entirely independent
of `/mission undo`'s own stack (flow 4).

**Undoing an approval no longer replays individual client writes.** The
2026-08-16 full-kill-undo redesign
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-full-kill-undo-design.md`) replaced the
old five-write sequence (`updatePhotoStatusForRoom` + `handlePlayerRevive` +
`remapPlayerAsTarget`, run one at a time from the browser, which only ever
reverted the target's own side of the kill) with a single atomic
`undoKillPlayer` Cloud Function call: it resets the photo's status and
restores every snapshotted player inside one Firestore transaction. Denying
an undo (reverting a Deny back to pending) is unchanged — it was always just
`updatePhotoStatusForRoom("pending")`, with no player data to restore.

---

## 4. Reviving a player

Two routes reach the same outcome, with different side effects.

        Note over CMF: one transaction — reads the task and whether the<br/>player is dead, decides via planMissionCompletion, revives<br/>the player, and runs the same planRemap regeneration<br/>RemapPlayers.js runs client-side for /revive, but inside<br/>this same transaction — see flow 3

        CI-->>GM: RemapPlayerModal, handlePlayerRevive

        CI->>UMC: undoMissionCommand(roomID)
        UMC->>UMCCF: httpsCallable('undoMissionCommand', {roomId})
        Note over UMCCF: one transaction: reads the room's<br/>lastMissionCommandCompletion (errors "Nothing to undo." if<br/>absent), restores every snapshotted player verbatim,<br/>removes the player from completedBy (un-sets isComplete if<br/>auto-ended), clears lastMissionCommandCompletion to null —<br/>a command-anchored undo stack, independent of the<br/>photo-approval one (flow 3)
        UMCCF-->>UMC: (void)
        UMC-->>CI: resolved promise
        CI->>FS: addLog/broadcast("Undo: the last mission completion was reverted")
    end
```

A revived player keeps the score of `0` set at death — revival restores life but
not points. The third route back to life, undoing a photo approval, _does_
restore the score, so the two paths are inconsistent.

`/revive` alerts the GM (`"<name>" is not dead`) when the named player is
not in the dead list — previously the `if` had no `else`, so a typo
produced no feedback at all; fixed by `docs/improvements.md` item 21.

---

## 5. Leaving or being removed from the game

Two entry points, one shared server-side operation
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-player-leave-and-kick-design.md):
a player's own "Leave" button (`PlayerGame.js`), and a moderator's
`/kick <player>` command (`ChatInput.js`). Both call into
`functions/callableFunctions/removePlayer.js`'s shared `removeAndRemap`
step, which mirrors `killPlayer`'s unmap-then-remap section — minus the
score transfer and `isAlive` reset, since this deletes the player's
document outright rather than marking them dead.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Player
    actor GM
    participant PG as PlayerGame
    participant CI as ChatInput
    participant LG as leaveGame (client)
    participant RP as removePlayer (client)

    participant FS as Firestore

    Player->>PG: taps Leave, confirms
    PG->>LG: leaveGame(roomID)
    LG->>CF: httpsCallable('leaveGame', {roomId})
    CF->>FS: runTransaction: find player by uid, unmap, remap, delete
    CF->>FS: write own logs + playerMessages announcement
    CF-->>LG: {removedPlayerName, addedTargets, addedAssassins, remapLogs}
    LG-->>PG: same response
    PG->>PG: sign out, clear session, navigate home

    GM->>CI: /kick alice
    CI->>RP: removePlayer(playerName, roomID)
    RP->>CF: httpsCallable('removePlayer', {roomId, playerName})
    CF->>FS: runTransaction: host check, find player by name, unmap, remap, delete
    CF-->>RP: {removedPlayerName, addedTargets, addedAssassins, remapLogs}
    RP-->>CI: same response
    CI->>CI: addLog + broadcast "alice was removed from the game"
    CI->>CI: handleRemapping / handleAddNewTargets / handleAddNewAssassins
```

**No score changes hands.** Unlike a kill, nobody gains the removed
player's points.

**No undo.** Neither path has a reversal mechanism, deliberately — this
is meant to be final.

**Works pre-game too.** A player who hasn't been assigned targets yet
(still in the Lobby waiting room) has empty `targets`/`assassins` arrays,
so the remap step is a no-op — the same Cloud Function handles both
phases without branching.

---

## 6. Reconnecting mid-game

A player whose device lost its session (new browser, cleared storage, a
second device) can reclaim their existing identity once the game has
started, subject to GM approval
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-player-reconnect-design.md). Two entry
points on the player side (`JoinGame.js`'s fallback, `ReconnectPending.js`
watching the outcome) and one on the GM side (`ReconnectRequests.js`), all
routed through `functions/callableFunctions/reconnectRequest.js`'s three
callables.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Player
    actor GM
    participant JG as JoinGame
    participant JRCF as joinRoom (Cloud Function)
    participant RR as requestReconnect (client)
    participant RRCF as requestReconnect (Cloud Function)

    participant RREQ as ReconnectRequests (GM console)

    participant FS as Firestore

    Player->>JG: submits Game ID + name
    JG->>JRCF: httpsCallable('joinRoom', {roomId, playerName})
    JRCF-->>JG: rejected — "This game has already started."
    Note over JG: only this specific rejection triggers the fallback below —<br/>any other joinRoom error (bad room, duplicate name pre-game)<br/>surfaces as a normal error instead
    JG->>RR: requestReconnect(gameId, playerName)

    RP->>FS: onSnapshot(reconnectRequests/{requestId})

    FS-->>RREQ: onSnapshot (all pending reconnectRequests, live)
    RREQ-->>GM: render "<name> wants to reconnect" row

    alt GM approves
        GM->>RREQ: Approve
        RREQ->>JCF: httpsCallable('approveReconnectRequest', {roomId, requestId})
        JCF->>FS: runTransaction: host check, request still pending,<br/>player doc still exists, requester's uid not already linked<br/>to a different player, re-link player.uid, joinedUids<br/>arrayUnion, request status → "approved"
        JCF-->>RREQ: (void)
        RREQ->>FS: addLog("<name> reconnected") + broadcast
        FS-->>RP: onSnapshot fires, status "approved"
        RP->>RP: writePlayerSession(roomID, playerName)
        RP->>RP: navigate(/rooms/{roomID}/waiting)
    else GM denies
        GM->>RREQ: Deny
        RREQ->>JCF: httpsCallable('denyReconnectRequest', {roomId, requestId})
        JCF->>FS: runTransaction: host check, request still pending,<br/>request status → "denied"
        JCF-->>RREQ: (void)
        FS-->>RP: onSnapshot fires, status "denied"
        RP-->>Player: "Your reconnect request was denied"
    end
```

**No host check on the request itself.** `requestReconnect` is callable by
any signed-in caller — the entire premise is that the caller has just lost
whatever identity they had before and cannot prove anything about
themselves yet. `joinRoom`'s own "already started" rejection is what
routed them here; `requestReconnect` doesn't trust that and re-checks the
room's `gameStarted`/`isGameActive`/`endedAt` independently.

**One pending request per device per player name.** A second
`requestReconnect` call for the same player name, from the same uid, while
an earlier one is still pending, is rejected outright — guards against a
flaky retry or a double-tapped button, not a determined multi-identity
flood, which this game's small, in-person, GM-supervised setting doesn't
need to defend against.

**Approval is one atomic write.** The player document's `uid`, the room's
`joinedUids`, and the request's own `status` all land inside a single
transaction — `ReconnectPending.js` only navigates the player back into
the game once `joinedUids` already contains this device's uid, so there is
no window where the live-updated request looks approved but the room
still rejects this device's reads.

**Interplay with player removal (flow 5).** If the player named in a
still-pending reconnect request is kicked or leaves before the host
judges it, `removeAndRemap` — the shared step both `leaveGame` and
`removePlayer` call — finds that pending request and marks it `denied` in
the very same transaction that deletes the player's document, so it never
sits dangling, approvable into a player doc that no longer exists.
`removeAndRemap` also prunes the departing player's own `uid` from the
room's `joinedUids` in that same transaction, revoking that device's room
access outright.

## Where each flow updates the screen

Because [state lives in three places](./architecture.md#state-management), each
flow updates the UI differently:

| Surface                                        | Mechanism                                                                       | Stale after reload?    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Player list with scores and targets            | `onSnapshot`                                                                    | No — always live       |
| Photo queue                                    | `onSnapshot`                                                                    | No — always live       |
| Reconnect request queue (GM console)           | `onSnapshot`                                                                    | No — always live       |
| Reconnect status (requester's own screen)      | `onSnapshot` on the single request doc                                          | No — always live       |
| Log panel                                      | `onSnapshot` (`docs/improvements.md` item 22)                                   | No — always live       |
| `Players (n)` header count                     | derived from the same live `onSnapshot` roster (item 13)                        | No — always live       |
| Alive/dead arrays driving `/revive` validation | refetched via `fetchPlayersByStatusForRoom` on every command                    | No — always current    |
| Photo undo history                             | persisted on the photo doc itself (`preKillSnapshot`), not React state (item 6) | No — survives a reload |
