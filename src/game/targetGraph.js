/**
 * The target-assignment rules, as pure functions.
 *
 * Previously this logic existed in three places — `TargetGenerator.js`,
 * `ResetTargetsButton.js`, and (in a differently-shaped variant)
 * `RemapPlayers.js` — each inside a React closure, each entangled with
 * Firestore writes. Nothing here touches Firebase or React: callers pass a
 * roster in and get a plan out, then hand that plan to the data layer.
 *
 * Randomness arrives as an `rng` parameter so tests can pin it.
 *
 * CommonJS exports, not `export`/`import` — this file (and remapPlan.js,
 * which depends on it) is also `require()`d directly by the Cloud Function
 * in functions/callableFunctions/killPlayer.js (docs/improvements.md item 4),
 * which runs under plain Node with no build step. Every existing `import`
 * of this file on the client side keeps working unchanged: webpack's
 * CommonJS interop resolves named imports against `module.exports` the
 * same way it would against a real ES module.
