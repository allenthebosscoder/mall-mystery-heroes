/**
 * Pure logic for splitting a room's photo documents into "still needs a
 * judgment" and "already judged" buckets, and reconstructing what an undo
 * would need from each judged one.
 *
 * Extracted from PhotosDisplay.js's onSnapshot callback (docs/improvements.md
 * item 6): judgedPhotos used to live only in React state, built up as the GM
 * clicked through a session, so reloading the console lost every prior
 * judgment even though Firestore still had it — the undo button looked live
 * but had nothing to act on. Firestore is now the source of truth for both
 * buckets; this is the piece decidable from data alone.
