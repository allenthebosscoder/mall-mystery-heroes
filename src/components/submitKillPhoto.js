/**
 * Submits a kill-photo claim on the caller's own behalf — the Cloud
 * Function derives who "the caller" is from their own signed-in identity,
 * so there is no assassin name to pass here, only which target and which
 * already-uploaded photo url
 * (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-identity-verified-player-writes-design.md).
 * uploadKillPhoto (storageCalls.js) still handles the Storage upload
 * itself, unchanged — this only writes the Firestore doc pointing at it.
 *
 * @throws if the caller isn't a player of the room, the game has ended,
 *   the url isn't a legitimate photo for this room, the rate limit is
 *   exceeded, target/mission aren't exactly-one-set, or the given target
 *   or mission doesn't exist — surfaces as a rejected promise carrying
 *   `.message`, same as executeKill.js (docs/improvements.md item 10's
 *   error-propagation pattern needs no changes to handle this).
