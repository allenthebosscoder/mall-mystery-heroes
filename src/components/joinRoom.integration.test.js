/**
 * Layer 1b — the player self-registration Cloud Function, against the
 * real Functions, Firestore, and Auth emulators together.
 *
 * Run with `npm run test:emulator`. `joinRoom` is a thin wrapper around
 * `httpsCallable(functions, 'joinRoom')` — these tests call it exactly
 * the way a real player's device would, then assert on what actually
 * landed in Firestore, matching executeKill.integration.test.js's own
 * stance (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-player-access-and-room-lifecycle-design.md).
