# CLAUDE.md

GM console for a live-action assassin game. Create React App + Firebase, no
backend of our own. Start with `docs/architecture.md`; `docs/data-model.md` is
the only record of the Firestore schema and is reconstructed from call sites.

## The gate

Run all four before claiming anything is done. CI runs the same set.

```bash
npm run format      # Prettier, 4-space, rewrites in place
npm run lint        # ESLint, --max-warnings=0
npm test            # Jest
npm run build       # CRA production build
```

## Where code goes

| Kind                                              | Location                                   | Rule                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Game rules, parsing, anything decidable from data | `src/game/`                                | Pure. No Firebase, no React, no `Math.random()` without an injectable `rng`.                  |
| Firestore reads/writes                            | `src/components/firebase_calls/dbCalls.js` | The only place the SDK is touched (two legacy exceptions: `UnmapPlayers.js`, `DashBoard.js`). |
| Components                                        | `src/pages/`, `src/components/`            | Thin. Call into `src/game/`, hand the result to `dbCalls`.                                    |

**Separate deciding from writing.** `planRemap` returns a list of writes rather
than performing them; keep that shape when adding logic. It is what makes the
rules testable and what a future `writeBatch` will need.

## Tests

The filename extension routes the test to an environment — see `jest.config.js`:

- `src/game/**/*.test.js`, `src/utils/**/*.test.js` → **node** project. Pure, no DOM.
- `src/**/*.test.jsx` → **jsdom** project, Testing Library, asset stubs.

**Never import `dbCalls.js` or `utils/firebase.js` from a unit test.**
`src/utils/firebaseEnv.js` throws under `NODE_ENV=test` unless emulators are
enabled — deliberately, because `.firebaserc` points `dev` and `prod` at the
same live project. If you need the data layer in a test, it belongs in the
emulator-backed layer, not the unit layer. See `docs/testing.md`.

Write the test first and watch it fail. Every module in `src/game/` was built
that way.

## Environments

`REACT_APP_USE_EMULATORS=true` lives in `.env.development` — read by
`npm start` only. It must never go in `.env`, which `npm run build` reads and
would bake into a production bundle.

## Traps

- **Player names must be lowercase.** Commands lowercase their arguments but
  `dbCalls` queries the case-preserved `name` field. A player entered as
  `Alice` cannot be referenced from the command bar. `improvements.md` item 1.
- **`dbCalls` swallows errors** — most functions `try/catch`, log, and return
  `undefined`. Callers don't check, so failures surface as a `TypeError` on
  `.docs[0]` somewhere unrelated.
- **`GameMasterView` state disagrees with Firestore.** Its player arrays are
  fetched once on mount and mutated optimistically, while `PlayersList` and
  `PhotosDisplay` use live `onSnapshot`. Don't write component tests asserting
  game-state outcomes until that's fixed (`improvements.md` item 13).
- **`src/components/old-components/` is dead code** — unreferenced, imports
  already broken. Excluded from Prettier and ESLint. Don't fix it; it should be
  deleted.
- **`/kill` and photo approval take different paths** and produce different
  graphs for the same event (`improvements.md` item 5).

## Before starting work

Check `docs/improvements.md` — the bug you're about to hit is probably already
triaged there, with the intended fix.
