// Cloud Functions deploy uploads only the functions/ directory in
// isolation (firebase.json's functions[0].source) — a require() reaching
// outside it, like '../../src/game/...', resolves fine locally and under
// the emulator (both run from the full repo checkout) but cannot resolve
// in the actual deployed bundle. This copies the specific src/game/
// modules killPlayer.js and joinRoom.js depend on into functions/vendor/
// so the deployed package is self-contained. Run before every deploy
// (firebase.json's functions[0].predeploy) and before local emulator
// tests, which exercise the same require paths the real deploy uses.
//
// functions/vendor/ is gitignored — src/game/ stays the single source of
// truth; this is a regenerated build artifact, not a second copy to keep
// in sync by hand.
