 * The atomic replacement for the client-side kill flow
 * (docs/improvements.md item 4): score transfer, unmapping the victim from
 * every neighbor, the victim's own reset, and the remap that follows, all
 * inside one Firestore transaction. Previously this was ~9-15 separate,
 * unbatched writes from the browser — a dropped connection partway through
 * could leave the game in a state nothing detected or repaired.
 *
 * Runs under the Admin SDK, which bypasses firestore.rules entirely — the
 * host check below is what enforces authorization here; rules aren't
 * consulted for anything this function does.
